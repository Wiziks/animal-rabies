# Animal Rabies
Animal Rabies is a side-view shooter. The main character needs to destroy all the animals that have gone mad in the city. The game features several types of animals with different abilities and behavior patterns:

    – The pig can only walk between given points. When colliding with it, the player receives damage. This unit can move not only on a flat plane. A beam is fired from the pig that determines the nearest plane to move. Thanks to raycast, the unit "sticks" to the surface.
    – The squirrel stands still and occasionally shoots acorns in three different directions (up, left, right). When colliding with a squirrel or acorn, the player receives damage.
    – The chicken flies the shortest way to the player. When shot at it, thanks to the joint, the unit seems to oscillate from the impact. When colliding with it, the player receives damage.
    – The hare stands still and shoots a carrot at the player's last position. In case of a collision with a hare or a carrot, the player receives damage.
    – The bear hovers in the air and shoots missiles at the player that chase the player until they detonate. Rockets detonate upon collision with any object. When colliding with a bear or missiles, the player takes damage.

    During the jump, the player does somersaults, knows how to bend. Several different mechanics are available in the game:

    – There are two weapons for shooting in the game: one initial, and the other bonus. The first has an infinite number of bullets and a low rate of fire. The second is selected from bonuses and has a finite supply of bullets and a high rate of fire. When they are finished, the weapon disappears.
    – Rocketjump is available as an active skill. When pressing the appropriate button, the player fires a weapon and flies in the opposite direction. After that, the skill becomes unavailable for a few seconds.
    – Time is slowed down by pressing the appropriate button. It applies to everything except skill reloads and weapon rate of fire.
    – The player can release a grappling hook to grab onto a surface or enemy. The hook is the same length as it was from the beginning, when it caught on something.
    – When picking up the "HP" bonus, the player adds one life.
